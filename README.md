# boss-minigame
repository for the boss mini game challenge

This program is a challenge form the book 'C# Player's Guide', which asks the students to create small text-base game in the console where there are 2 players, 
one takes the role of the city of 'Consolas' which is the defender and the other takes the role of the enemy airship 'The Manticore' which is the attacker.

My take on this challenge was a different one than the one proposed in the book, my take is small boss rush type of game where the player will try to beat all the 3 bosses. 
The player starts with 20 points of HP and 2 of attack power and for each boss defeated the player receives a buff of 5 points to its HP and plus 1 to its attack power.

There are 3 different bosses with different stats, each enemy difficulty goes from easy to hard.

At the end of the game depending on how many bosses the player managed to kill it will receive a different rank.
